<h1>Information Regarding the use of this script</h1>


<p1>Had users needing copy with pipe custom ribbon in Excel that would always have to add it manually once they started Excel. I wrote this script to copy the ribbon file and make sure it would be available on startup with Excel. 
This was in an Enterprise environment with scripts being blocked by policy, so we would need to Set-ExecutionPolicy before the script would work.
